        <h2>making the fringes of the ds library look nice is twilightmenu, one ips patch at a time</h2>
        <p class="sm">or; ds download play meets anal retentive romhacking</p>
        <p>
          so i basically set up my ds with twilightmenu and i
          wanted a buncha kiosk demos in there too right? and while
          most of them have descriptive banners, for example:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/assets/images/mkds.jpg" alt="Nintendo DS BIOS screenshot of the demo patch in action.">
          <figcaption>screenshot taken in melonDS because i'm lazy as shit.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          the DS download station releases all have generic banners! completely
          understandable though - they weren't intended to used by the public, and it 
          appears that in normal use (i.e. renouned gamestop employee Mr. McLastName puttin one of 'em in an 
          actual store kiosk DS in 2007, or buying one of these carts off ebay in 2022 and plopping it into 
          your average retail DS Lite) you wouldn't even see the banner on 'em; the DS boots directly into
          the "game".
        </p>
        <p>
          but if you're crazy enough to have ALL of the DS download station ROMS on your 
          twilightmenu setup, this naturally looks quite bad unforunately.

        <p>
          changing the banner text is a pretty easy thing to do though! <a href="https://github.com/pleonex/tinke" class="link">tinke</a>,
          a DS rom unpacking and editing tool, makes editing the banner text trivial, so i just did that at first:

          <img src="/assets/images/muchbetter.jpg" alt="Picture of the same physical DS, now with properly titles Download Station ROMs. A ROM titled 'DS Download Station Volume 7', published by Nintendo, is selected.">
        </figure>
        <p>
          it's kind of a pointless niche thing but i did it anyway and figured i'd share it. these are xdelta patches because i don't
          wanna get sued. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jXQEf2OXSK8crumWHOz4tsyGW02RCNmP?usp=sharing" class="link">here's</a> a link to the folder on google drive.
          the no-intro ROMs should work, i believe they're what i used. don't ask me where to get those but there's Archives and Lairs that should have them. 
          good luck out there, don't get the nintendo ninjas on your ass for ilicitly downloading ds download station volume 7 on the nintendo ds. 
        </p>
        <p>i may do some more of these patches at some point for other DS kiosk carts if i get around to it, but who knows.</p>
